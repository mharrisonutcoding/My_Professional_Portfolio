# My_Professional_Portfolio
 My working professional portfolio for my catalog of deployed projects

My focus will be creating a solid HTML and CSS structure using semantic code to facilitate my ability to update my portfolio as I complete and deploy new projects.

Acceptance Criteria for Completion:

WHEN a user loads my portfolio, 
THEN they are presented clearly with My Name, Recent Photo or Avatar,      Links to Sections About Theme, My Work, and How to Contact Me
WHEN a user clicks any of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI will scroll to the corresponding section
WHEN a user clicks the link to the section with My Work
THEN the UI will scroll to a section with titled images of my Applications
WHEN a user finds my first application
THEN the application will be identified by being larger in size than the other applications
WHEN a user clicks on the image of the applications
THEN that user is taken to that deployed application
WHEN a user resizes the page or views from different devices
THEN the webpage will have a responsive layout that adapts to any user viewport

Primary Languages I will use will be HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
